# Black Lung Detection project
Implemented a Deep CNN model for Detection of pneumoconioses Patients Using Chest X-Ray Images. Built the model using Transfer Learning by fine-tuning pre-trained model  DenseNet121 that have been pre-trained on ImageNet dataset.

Fifty-five Chest X-Ray diagnosed with pneumoconioses from B-reader Syllabus and sixty normal Chest X-Ray from ChexPert.
